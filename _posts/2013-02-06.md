Let's build an example:
---

Print foo

    >>> foo = 'foo'
    >>> print(foo)
    foo

Print foo from a function

    >>> def print_foo():
    ...     print(foo)
    ...
    >>> print_foo()
    foo

Print foo from a function, change foo and print it again

    >>> def print_foo():
    ...     print(foo)
    ...     foo = 'FOO'
    ...     print(foo)
    ...
    >>> print_foo()
    Traceback (most recent call last):
        ...
    UnboundLocalError: local variable 'foo' referenced before assignment

Wait, what just happened?
